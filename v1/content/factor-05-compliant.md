# Factor 6: Compliant [draft]

**Definition:** Compliant data meets regulatory requirements with enforced access controls, clear ownership, and auditable AI-specific safeguards.

## Why It Matters

AI systems can't be used if they create legal, regulatory, or ethical liability. Compliance isn't optional—it's existential. GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, and emerging AI regulations impose strict requirements on how data can be collected, stored, processed, and used for AI. Violations result in fines, lawsuits, and reputational damage.

## Requirements

- Explicit data ownership and stewardship
- Role-based access controls enforced at query time
- PII detection and masking for AI workloads
- Bias monitoring in training data
- Audit trails for data access and usage
- Policies for acceptable AI use cases per dataset
- Consent tracking for AI-specific data usage
- Data retention and deletion capabilities

## Key Questions

- Do you have explicit consent to use your data for AI/ML purposes?
- Can you demonstrate compliance to an auditor?
- How do you detect and mitigate bias in training data?
- Can you fulfill a "right to be forgotten" request across all AI systems?
